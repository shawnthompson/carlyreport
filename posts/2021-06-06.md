- As terraces slowly begin to open and life returns to it’s long awaited new normal, my social anxiety begins to rise [#IDoNotKnowHowToHuman](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/idonotknowhowtohuman?__eep__=6&__gid__=123654164372747&__cft__[0]=AZU_fjpm4abrhguJHM5ZJD2Mca3a5l6k-2_ghyK0yhlNYMNl7KrZGuxdfsMXzxbc9ZId_AFRbnah6FamYc_YarO2yDfsNz-MDnrs5J50jwzWtMS5YnLZI_xlX7J4z2oIEkc&__tn__=*NK-R)
- The leaning benches have made their triumphant return into controversy
- We are excited for the reopening of the pool at the SGEC, although I can’t imagine a more "ick" situation than being surrounded by screaming children, Q92 blasting and people smiling while they pee in the deep end
- Nice little adorbs outdoor market open along Notre Dame serving you some high quality butternut squash
- We fightin’ again y’all
- Mott’s Clamato Caesar is giving your favourite local bar or restaurant $25,000, while V8 couldn't give a shit about us
- SOMEONE SAW A SNAIL
- How do we all feel about meal kit delivery? Clearly we LOVE it or at least love to push our discount cards into the group on a daily basis, let this serve as appreciation and acknowledgement
- Plant cutting of various attractive categories including aloe, mint and strawberry were left in aesthetically pleasing pink cups in front of a No Parking sign on St-Ambroise because Receiving Gifts is clearly St-Henri’s chosen Love Language
- Happy to announce some re-openings that delight me including the terrace at both Luncheonette and Bagel St Henri as well as the reintroduction of Jazz on the Block
- Someone is requesting a beer in exchange for a Helix Gateway
- So many free fridges up for grabs that I’m considering a conspiracy
- The compost bin, who has been up for adoption for almost a week has finally found parents, we wish it all the best in its future endeavours
