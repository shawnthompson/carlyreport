- Help needed for a blocked toilet, someone looking for either a plumber or a live snake, serious applicants only (snake need not go through preliminary round of interviews, can skip right to the job)
- FREE IMPOSTER RUNNING SHOES, FEEL’S LIKE A 6, BUT IS SIZE 7
- Someone is renting an “open-concept” studio with “direct access to nature” and “the occasional bear” but is put simply one of the film locations from Deliverance [#DoesItHaveWifi](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/doesithavewifi?__eep__=6&__gid__=123654164372747&__cft__[0]=AZV13qXNfwilnCWaI75Q0xPc4JCGqHaFEtrnyt1RhHUjzTnIMyGM0KiazZTiNi1uvKtReV0qOfE55QeHiMREbZfRUCOEehg2JKSQij4pb0GQ0xHAb2ueXsLjJM0ZnT-hLUc&__tn__=*NK-R)?
- Public announcement, I would like to purchase a set of those diamond grills (yes I’m willing to have my “teeth pulled out for free and then put the diamonds back on”)
- Someone’s exotic pet bird headed down to the Atwater market for some Brie and overpriced tomatoes
- Nothing says community more than the group coming together to save the life of a dying plant
- Nail salon still looking for (paid) hand models, so if you got pretty hands but an ugly ass face, this is for you
- Do not hesitate to call 311 when you see garbage
- Bag of hangers in an IGA bag up for grabs in the group (probably the 10th time I’ve seen this)
- Let’s discuss fireworks, they are festive and aesthetically pleasing but fucking annoying and abit dangerous, let’s cease children, let’s cease.
- 2 Booster seats were left on the corner of Desnoyers and St-Jacques for the baby or annoying adult in your life.
